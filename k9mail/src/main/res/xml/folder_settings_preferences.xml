  Make sure to add android:persistent="false" to all preferences to disable saving
  the preference values to SharedPreferences. We use our own storage mechanism for
  the preferences. See tiscaliali.appmail.preferences.Storage.

  Also note that every sub-PreferenceScreen needs an "android:key" parameter so the correct screen
  can be displayed after the device has been rotated.
